Notes to Grader: The sky and ground have been created from textured cubes, with the textures being of a sunset sky and green-grass ground respectively. The llama's body includes a texture, with the tail including a different and darker-colored texture. The other parts of the body include other colored cubes.

There is a herd of llamas on the green field, and the goal is to spot the checkered-textured llama, especially before the shrubs continue to grow and take over the land. For the purpose of this assignment, I made it a little easier to locate said unique llama so that the user is able to have the opportunity to press the spacebar and receive the victory message.
