Notes to Grader: There are multiple cubes that make up the blocky animal (llama). There is a sphere, and the lighting (ambient + diffuse + specular) work with one another to create a more authentic three-dimensional scene. The visual marker of light location (yellow cube) exists at the top of the scene as it rotates around the world, and it can also be changed in the direction through the three sliders. The blocky llama exists within a simpler version of the world that was created in the third assignment. There is a faint spotlight on the llama, as well as a button to visualize the normals.
