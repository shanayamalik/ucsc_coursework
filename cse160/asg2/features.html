Notes to Grader: The blocky animal that I have made is of a llama, which I chose to create due to the gentle and nurturing nature of llamas, who are known for having a calm demeanor (except when aggravated). I find llamas to be particularly interesting due to being relatively large in size, often weighing up to 400 pounds, and also traveling in herds. The animation(s) that it has been given, include being able to wiggle ears depending on the emotion it is feeling (for example, if a llama is relaxed, the ears might tend to droop downward), wiggle the tail, run with the legs, and rotate the head and neck.
